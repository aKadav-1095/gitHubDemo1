In page object design, we create a separate class for each web page in the application.
Each class contains methods that represent actions that can be performed on that page, as well as locators for the elements on that page.
This approach helps to keep the test code clean and maintainable by separating the test logic from the page structure.
blank "__init__. py" file is used to mark a directory as a Python package, without it, Python will not recognize the directory as a package, and you won't be able to import modules from it.

syntax for class and methods:
class PageName:
    def __init__(self, driver):
        self.driver = driver

    def method_name(self):
        # code to interact with the page element
        pass
